\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
As the users of the platform include students, companies, and universities, the user interface is designed to facilitate interaction with 
the platform and meet their needs. For instance, many students may be unfamiliar with the internship search process and may lack experience
in finding job opportunities, so the user interface should be simple and intuitive to use.

The principal Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are described below and will be detailed further using mockups in the Design Document.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Welcome page:} The welcome page is the first page that the user sees when they access the platform. On this page, the user
    needs to select their user type (student, company, or university). Below that, there are two fields where the user can enter their email
    and password. Under these fields, there is a button to log in and a link to register if the user is not already registered.
    
    \item \textbf{Register Page:} In the registration phase, the user will first be asked to select their user type (student, company, or 
    university). Then, based on the selected user type, the platform will request different information to be filled in. 
    The following sections will describe in more detail the specific information required for each type of user during registration.

    \item \textbf{Notification Page:} 

    \item \textbf{student Interface:} The student interface includes all the pages and functionalities specifically designed for students.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Register Page for students:} In the registration phase, the student will first be asked to select their university. 
        Next, the student will need to provide the necessary personal information, such as name, email, phone number, etc. After submitting
        this information, the student must wait for a confirmation email to activate their account. Once the account is activated, the 
        platform will prompt the student to upload their CV to complete the registration process.

        \item \textbf{Internship Interface:}On this page, students can search for internships, view recommended internships based on their
         search, and see internships suggested by the platform's matching algorithm, which aligns their profile information with the 
         internships' requirements. Students can also view the details of available internships and apply for the ones that interest them.
        \item \textbf{Profile Page:} This page contains the student's personal data stored during the registration phase. On this page, 
        the student can edit their profile and update their CV.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Company Interface:} 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item \textbf{Register Page for companies:} 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{University Interface:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Register Page for universities:}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
