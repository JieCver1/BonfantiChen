\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}
Internships provide students with a valuable opportunity to apply their skills in real job environments while enabling companies to connect with 
fresh talent. However, the process of finding and securing internships can be challenging for both parties.

Students\&Companies (S\&C) is a platform designed to facilitate this connection throughout the internship process. It allows 
students to match their preferences with available opportunities, ensuring internships align with their experiences and skills. 
Companies can specify project requirements to attract suitable candidates.

The platform supports both students and companies in two phases: recommendation and selection. During the recommendation phase, 
it utilizes keyword searches and statistical analysis to assess internship information. Students can search for internships and receive 
notifications about appealing opportunities, while companies can publish offers and get alerts when student CVs match their criteria.
Once mutual interest is established, the selection phase begins, where the platform assists with interviews and finalizes the process. 
It also monitors the internship journey, providing feedback and enabling direct communication to address any questions.

Additionally, the universities of the students can oversee the process, possessing the authority to intervene and terminate internships 
if necessary.
