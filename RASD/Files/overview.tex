these questions through a form inside the platform. In said form Mr.Plankton also includes the date, time and location of the interview and the 
necessary information to better prepare the candidates. After sending the invitations, the candidates selected for the interview receive a notification 
from the platform, who is not selected will receive a notification of rejection. At the end of the interview, Mr.Plankton evaluates the candidates

he has gained, even though he has several complaints about the heavy workload. He decides to leave a warm message for Mr.Krabs and Mr.Plankton 
to thank them for the opportunity. After that, he navigates to the ``Internship'' section to add a review of his internship experience and rate
