\section{Document Structure}\label{sec:structure}
This document is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Section 1: Introduction} 
    \\It contains the summary of main architectural styles and choices that drive the design of the system. It also provides a brief description of the scope of the 
    project as already mentioned in the RASD. In addition, it include the specification of definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations of the terms used in this document. 
    At the end, it notes the revision history for updates to the document and the reference documents that were used during the development of this document.
    \item \textbf{Section 2: Architectural Design} 
    \\It provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, including the main components and their interactions. It also describes in detail each component
    by specifying the interfaces using the UML component diagram and list of the methods that each component can perform
    Then the deployment view of the system is presented with the description of the hardware and software components and the behavior of the system in runtime view 
    is presented with the sequence diagrams that illustrate the interactions. Finally the architectural styles and patterns chosen for the system will be 
    reported with a brief description of the reason for the choice.
    \item \textbf{Section 3: User Interface Design}
    \\In this section, the user interface design of the system is presented with a brief description of the interactions between each component and mockups that 
    illustrate the main functionalities of the system. With respect to the RASD, this section provides a more detailed description of the user interface design and 
    highlights the interactions from the perspectives of different types of users.
    \item \textbf{Section 4: Requirements Traceability}
    \\It connects the requirements of the system with the components of the architecture presented in the previous sections by providing a table that maps each
    requirement to the components that implement it. 
    \item \textbf{Section 5: Implementation, Integration, and Test Plan}
    \\Describe the plan for the implementation, integration, and testing of the system. It includes the description of the development process and emphasizes the
    the order of the implementation of the components withing the specification of the reason for the choice. It also includes the description of the testing
    process and the aim of each test case.
    \item \textbf{Section 6: Effort Spent}
    \\The time spent by each group member on each task will be registered in this section. It will be used to present the effort dedicated 
    by each member and to present the progress of the development of the project.
